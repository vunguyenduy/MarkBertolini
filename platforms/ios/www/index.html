        Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini talks with Alignyo about Yoga
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini practices yoga, pranayama and mindfulness everyday and has made it his mission to make it available to Aetna employees. In our interview with Mark, he discusses how yoga helped him heal from a skiing accident and shares statistics on the positive effects of mindfulness programs in the workplace.</div><br/>

        <div>Can you share how you found yoga and what your "cocktail" is?</div><br/>

        <div>I had a skiing accident in 2004 that resulted in a spinal cord injury and constant pain from neuropathy. I did not want to be on controlled substances for pain, so I tried a number of alternative medicines - cranialsacral therapy, acupuncture, mindfulness and yoga. This combination, which I call my cocktail, has worked to the point where I don’t take any pain medication and can be fully present in the moment.</div><br/>

        <div>Mindfulness in the workplace - why is this important?</div><br/>

        <div>It can help employees be more productive and make better decisions for the organization, which helps improve the bottom line of a business. Research from the mindfulness program we now offer to all Aetna employees shows that participants are regaining 69 minutes per week of productivity. This increase in productivity equates to an 11:1 return on investment.</div><br/>

        <div>Mindfulness and yoga-based programs can also help reduce stress, which is a universal issue that can damage people’s health. Our research found that employees reporting the highest stress level had nearly $2,000 higher medical costs for the preceding year than those reporting the lowest stress levels. These programs were successfully proven to reduce stress, which can help reduce associated health care costs.</div><br/>

        <div>If the results are quantifiable - as indicated - what are the next steps? Are programs being rolled-out at Aetna and beyond and what does this actually look like - yoga at lunchtime? Meditation in the morning?</div><br/>

        <div>In 2010, we studied the use of two mind-body stress reduction workplace programs with a select group of Aetna employees. The programs - Mindfulness at Work™ (mindfulness meditation) and Viniyoga Stress Reduction (therapeutic Viniyoga) – were developed and studied in a collaborative effort with Aetna, Duke Integrative Medicine, eMindful and the American Viniyoga Institute.</div><br/>

        <div>Our results showed that these programs helped reduce stress levels significantly, so we now make these programs available to all Aetna employees. More than 6,000 Aetna employees – about 20 percent of our employee population – have participated in one of these programs.</div><br/>

        <div>After seeing these results within our own company, we also began offering these programs to our customers. We are confident that the customers that implement the programs will help their employees deal with stress more effectively, help them achieve better overall health and lower their costs associated with stress.</div><br/>

        <div>Finally, we are incorporating mindfulness-based approaches into other wellness programs, such as programs that teach mindful eating to help reduce obesity.</div><br/>

        <div>Do you practice yoga every day and what style do you prefer?</div><br/>

        <div>Every morning I get up and I do my asana, pranayama, meditation, and Vedic chanting before work. It’s helped me be more centered, more present. I’ve been practicing Viniyoga for almost seven years.</div><br/>

        Aetna CEO on Being Part of Obamacare “It’s Been a Rough Go”
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini said on Tuesday that, while insuring more people is an important goal, it may be time to rethink the current Obamacare system.</div><br/>

        <img class="a-img" src="img/IMG_2703-640x426.jpg"/>
        <div>“We are one of the alpha testers for the federal marketplace, and it has been a rough go,” Bertolini said, speaking at the Techonomy conference near Tucson, Ariz. “What we need to do is start to consider other solutions that will help the system.”</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna is part of the federal health exchanges in 132 markets, but Bertolini said it may be time to figure out an interim approach and rebuild a stronger system.</div><br/>

        <div>“We’ve got to admit we need to fix the thing in a fundamental way,” he said.</div><br/>

        <div>Just how much repair is needed won’t be known until the government and the industry can “look at what do we have versus what we thought we were going to get,” he said.</div><br/>

        <div>“This issue is not about who was right or wrong,” he said. “This is about getting people who are uninsured insured. We’re trying to help. We want to see it work.”</div><br/>

        Aetna will not reinstate individual insurance plans
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Aetna Inc has decided not to reinstate or extend individual health insurance plans that are being canceled with the advent of the U.S. Affordable Care Act because the time frame is too short.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna is the largest insurer yet to announce a decision on how it would proceed across the United States after President Barack Obama said last month that insurers could extend these health plans under a temporary transitional policy.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna's move means that some consumers, who are required to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a fine, will need to buy a new plan for 2014. Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini made the comments at an investor meeting on Thursday.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna, the third-largest U.S. insurer, declined to say how many individuals have plans that are being canceled or how many were offered early renewals on their expiring 2013 plans to enable them to continue coverage into 2014.</div><br/>

        <div>The company would have had to seek approvals for rate increases across the United States, which it said would distract it at a busy time of year.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna's move is in contrast to some state-based Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, such as BCBS of Florida and BCBS of North Carolina, which have said they would extend these plans under the transitional policy.</div><br/>

        <div>Obama made the policy change allowing insurers to extend health plans under a temporary policy after hundreds of thousands of individuals received notices that their plans were being canceled. The cancellations became a political issue because Obama had promised Americans that if they liked their plan, they could keep it.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna said that it has offered early renewals on plans, which allow consumers to keep their coverage for up to a year longer and into late 2014.</div><br/>

        <div>"We talked to the insurance commissioners and the insurance commissioners have agreed with us. If we were to go to all those states, refile all those plans, refile all those rates and do it in time for December 23, we would have paid attention to nothing else," Bertolini said.</div><br/>

        <div>Consumers must decide whether to buy plans on the exchanges by December 23 for coverage to start on January 1, 2014.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna is offering plans in 16 states, which means it covers about 30 percent of the exchange marketplace. The exchanges, created under the Affordable Care Act, opened on October 1 to sell plans for 2014. Technology problems have hobbled the ability of consumers to sign up and highlighted the cancellation issue.</div><br/>

        <div>Some state insurance commissioners have said they will not allow these plans to continue while others have said they would allow insurers who rushed early renewals in by December 31 to continue them in 2014.</div><br/>

        <div>Still other state commissioners have simply left it up to the insurers to decide. A few million plans were due to be canceled in 2014 and it is not clear yet how many people will in fact lose coverage.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna said it expects to gain customers in only about 15 percent of the marketplaces where it is priced the most competitively.</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini said he expects the public health insurance exchanges, which are under attack by Republicans, to survive the technology issues.</div><br/>

        <div>"By 2015, if we get it fixed right, it'll be a new start," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>In addition to front-end issues, the website has also had problems communicating data about enrollees to the insurance companies. The U.S. government said last week that over the first two months running the exchange, one in four transmissions had errors. That rate is now about one in ten, the government said.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna said it is still seeing these problems, but could not provide an estimate of how many submissions have errors.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said he is worried about consumers being confused about whether they are enrolled in a plan.</div><br/>

        <div>"With where we are now it inevitably will happen," Guertin said in an interview. "We tried to extend our payment dates to head that particular situation off, but when you look at the number of applications that we have and you look at the number of people that have actually paid for January 1 coverage, it's a relatively low number as a percentage."</div><br/>

        <div>"It does worry me a little bit whether people actually understand they have to pay that first month's premium," he said. Aetna has extended the payment date to January 8 for January 1 coverage.</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini said it is important to get the information right in time for January and that the company has been working closely with the government.</div><br/>

        <div>"We're coming up with workaround solutions in case things aren't ready," he said. "There is a lot of that cooperation going on now, whereas in the past it was pretty much hands off, but once the stuff really hit the fan there was a lot of engagement."</div><br/>

        The end of health insurance as we know it
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini caused quite a stir when he said at a Las Vegas conference a few days ago that the insurance industry as we know it is, for all practical purposes, a dinosaur on the verge of extinction.</div><br/>

        <div>Time to sing, “Ding dong the witch is dead”? Not quite, but the day when most Americans get their coverage from what we think of as an insurance company is close at hand.  It won’t be long before most of us get coverage through either a state or federal government-run plan or a local nonprofit company. The big investor-owned corporations like Aetna and the companies I used to work for, Cigna and Humana, know that the days of making a killing off of basic medical insurance policies are over. And the companies have no one to blame but themselves and a fatally flawed, uniquely American system of providing access to care.</div><br/>

        <div>While Bertolini was by no means predicting that Aetna and its competitors were about to close their doors and get the hell out of our lives, he most certainly sounded the death knell for the standard business model insurers have followed for many years — actually insuring people.</div><br/>

        <div>“The system doesn’t work. It’s broke today,” he said. “The end of insurance companies, the way we’ve run the business in the past, is here.”</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini ticked off a number of reasons why providing basic health insurance to Americans was no longer viable — changes in demographics and the economy and, of course, health care reform at both the state and federal levels. What he did not say was that the standard operating practices of the industry were simply not sustainable and actually contributed more to the demise of the business model than any external factors.</div><br/>

        <div>Ever since the health insurance industry came to be dominated in recent years by a handful of big for-profit corporations, insurers have actually been driving away customers and shrinking the universe of people they were willing to cover, because of the return on investment and the profit demands of the large institutional investors that own most of the corporations’ shares. It is because of those demands that insurers price their premiums beyond the reach of millions of Americans. It is because of those demands that insurers reject on average a third or more of all applicants because of “preexisting conditions.” And it is because of those demands that insurers have routinely canceled the coverage of thousands of policyholders when they got sick. Now you know why more than 50 million of us are uninsured. It is not because most of those people are being irresponsible. Most of them either can’t afford to buy coverage or can’t buy it at any price.</div><br/>

        <div>The number of people who get their coverage through the workplace is also declining because of shareholders’ profit demands. As recently as the early 1990s, more than 60 percent of small businesses were able to offer coverage to their employees. Now it’s well below 50 percent. Over the past two decades, insurers have methodically “purged” small businesses when an employee or dependent got sick or seriously injured.</div><br/>

        <div>Even though the population of the United States increased by more than 27 million during the 2000s, the number of people enrolled in managed care plans declined significantly, according to U.S. Census Bureau data — from 179.4 million in 2000 to 169.4 million in 2009.</div><br/>

        <div>As a former managed-care analyst was quoted as saying in Barron’s last October, "There's no organic growth left in this business except for pricing."</div><br/>

        <div>Another standard — but unsustainable — industry practice is shifting more of the cost of care from insurers to their policyholders, and from employers to their workers, through ever-increasing deductibles. You can’t keep making consumers pay more and more for their care and expect them to see the value of buying coverage. My former colleagues in the industry estimated, in private meetings, that the average American family could not afford to pay more than 16 percent of its total household budget for medical insurance and out-of-pocket deductibles.  </div><br/>

        <div>These unsustainable business practices explain why insurers were so insistent that the Affordable Care Act contain a mandate that every American not eligible for a government program like Medicare or Medicaid be required to buy coverage from a private insurer and that  those unable to pay the premiums be given subsidies by the government — subsidies that would go directly to the insurers.</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini was correct in noting that the Affordable Care Act — which essentially will ban medical underwriting after 2014 as well as several anti-consumer practices — has accelerated the timeframe in which the industry’s current business model bites the dust. But reform was only an accelerant.</div><br/>

        Arianna Interview Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini On De-Stressing
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Guest-hosting CNBC's 'Squawk Box' on Tuesday morning, Arianna interviewed Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini about "his mission - to bring the mindfulness benefits that [he] brought to 34,000 employees to everyone in America."</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini described finding that "when employees are in the highest quintile of stress, their health care costs are $2,000 higher than the average employee."</div><br/>

        <div>The CEO described a 12-week program that thousands of his employees completed: "We measured both pre-and-post heart rate variability and productivity of those employees. We saw dramatic drops in stress... and 69-minute gain in productivity of our employees over a year. The result for us was an 11:1 return on that investment."</div><br/>

        <div>Arianna brought up Bertolini's own path to well-being--he fell down a ravine and broke his neck in a skiing accident and spent a year taking painkillers until he discovered yoga and meditation.</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini said of his experience: "The medical system gave me drugs. The disability system told me to go on long-term disability. But if you read the literature it says that you need to be active at work, you need to have a purpose, and I couldn't do that on the seven different drugs they were giving me to control my pain."</div><br/>

        Boost Bottom Lines, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini Says
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Company wellness programs for employees that include complementary medicine features like yoga can benefit bottom lines, according to Mark Bertolini, chief executive of the health insurer Aetna.</div><br/>

        <div>When Aetna determined in 2010 that its workers with the highest levels of stress were costing the company $2,000 more each year than co-workers, the company created an initiative to promote yoga and meditation, Bertolini said at the Third Metric conference co-sponsored by The Huffington Post in New York Thursday. The results include improvements in heart rates and increased productivity, and help Aetna reduce its employee health benefit costs by 7 percent in 2012, he said.</div><br/>

        <div>Workplace programs to promote employee wellness by using financial incentives to discourage tobacco use and encourage exercise alongside health insurance benefits designed to increase the use of preventive medical services like cholesterol tests have grown increasingly common as companies seek to reduce health care spending. President Barack Obama's health care reform law includes provisions intended to broaden access to such benefits, which may make them even more widely used.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna and other health insurance companies offer wellness programs and preventive benefits as parts of their products. Aetna's internal efforts to promote non-traditional activities like yoga and meditation aren't the norm, however.</div><br/>

        <div>For Bertolini, his interest in these methods began after he broke his neck during a skiing accident in 2004, he said. After undergoing surgery and spending a week in a coma, Bertolini's physicians prescribed pain medication and suggested he would have to change his lifestyle.</div><br/>

        <div>"The health care system couldn't help me," Bertolini said. "That began my journey into complementary medicine, which we used to refer to around the office 'voodoo medicine.'" Bertolini sought out a form of light head and body massage called craniosacral therapy, which helps him manage the chronic pain in his arm, he said. He later took up yoga and meditation and decided to spread these practices to his employees. Based on early results, heart rate variation among workers declined 500 percent and participants had 69 minutes of additional productivity each day, he said.</div><br/>

        <div>Skeptics of wellness programs caution that employers can use them to identify which employees are the sickest and most costly and use that information to squeeze them out, or use wellness programs as a way to charge some workers higher premiums. Others raise concerns about companies compiling personal medical information about employees.</div><br/>

        <div>More traditional wellness and prevention programs are key to improving Americans' health, and reducing health care spending, said Ezekiel Emanuel, the vice provost of global initiatives and chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania.</div><br/>

        <div>"The only way we're going to save money, improve the quality of care, improve people's lives is by focusing on prevention," said Emanuel, a former health care adviser to Obama who worked on the health care reform law from the White House.</div><br/>

        <div>Aspects of the health care reform law could help, such as a rule requiring health insurance companies to provide access to preventive services like cholesterol tests without charging co-payments, Emanuel said. The law also enables employers to increase the financial incentives offered to workers who attempt to improve their health and allows companies to include stress-reduction programs as part of wellness promotion.</div><br/>

        <div>"One of the ways you're really going to see whether health care reform is really going to work, over the next seven to 10 years, is does the system shift to really begin focusing on prevention?"</div><br/>

        <div>Although employee wellness programs also can be part of the solution to Americans' health being poorer in many ways than that of people in other nations, the evidence of their effectiveness is mixed, Emanuel said. "The bottom line is, we just don't know. We've never done the definitive study."</div><br/>

        <div>Emanuel cited a report published by the Rand Corp., a consulting firm, last month that concluded wellness programs have only modest effects on weight and cholesterol and don't save companies much money. These findings don't mean employers should give up, however, because some aspects of wellness programs can help, he said.</div><br/>

        <div>People who don't work at large companies that can finance wellness programs also should have access to these initiatives and greater access to preventive medicine. The medical community needs to emphasize these efforts alongside treating illness and injuries and the educational system should provide them for children, Emanuel said.</div><br/>

        <div>"Big corporations that employ well-off, well-paid workers can maybe afford to do this, but not every American works in such a corporation," Emanuel said. "These have to be solutions for all of society."</div><br/>

        New Aetna CEO brings style shift to insurer
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>(Reuters) - Aetna Inc (AET.N) President Mark Bertolini, who becomes CEO later this month, has half the kidneys and twice the energy of an ordinary human being and is set to take on the Herculean task of trying to change the health insurance industry's villainous image.</div><br/>

        <div>He also claims to possess unusual retention skills and to have figured out the mind-boggling science-fiction film "The Matrix" in the first five minutes.</div><br/>

        <div>While Bertolini, 54, and outgoing Chief Executive Ron Williams, who turns 61 on Thursday, have worked closely for years and are on the same page strategically as Aetna faces implementation of the new U.S. healthcare law, their vastly different personalities would suggest a significant style shift is coming in the executive suite in Hartford.</div><br/>

        <div>Williams, one of the nation's highest-profile CEOs, is dignified, reserved, almost always on message, and seems highly unlikely to discuss his personal life in a public forum.</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini by contrast is casual, conversational and quick to use a personal anecdote to make a point.</div><br/>

        <div>"You noticed," he quipped with a touch of sarcasm when the style differences were mentioned.</div><br/>

        <div>In a wide-ranging interview at the Reuters Health Summit in New York on Wednesday reporters learned, among other things, that Bertolini had donated a kidney to his son, takes medicine to keep his blood pressure low and has a golden retriever that "runs the house."</div><br/>

        <div>"My personal style of management is I'm involved," Bertolini said. "I spend a lot of time understanding details. I have a photographic memory, so people that work with me understand that what I see I retain in incredible volumes.</div><br/>

        <div>"I'm a hands-on person that spends a lot of time with my team and a lot of time with my work. I really love the work I do. I am passionate about making it better," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini sees one objective as boosting morale at Aetna after the insurance industry has been the favorite whipping boy in the heated debate around healthcare reform, accused of denying or dropping coverage for those most in need.</div><br/>

        <div>"At a time like this when it's very dark for people in our industry, our employees look at me and say 'are you the same person they're talking about on TV today as the immoral villain and do we really do the bad things everybody says we do as a company?'" Bertolini said.</div><br/>

        <div>"They need to understand that there is light at the end of all of this," he added.</div><br/>

        <div>"This is a tough time. Would I have picked being the CEO and a chairman of a company like this at this point in history? No! Who would want it?" he says with an easy chuckle.</div><br/>

        <div>CONSUMER, OR PATIENT</div><br/>

        <div>Bertolini divides people who use the healthcare system into consumers and patients, again reaching for the personal to illustrate the broader difference.</div><br/>

        <div>"When I broke my neck in a skiing accident six years ago I was not a consumer. I blew through my high deductible and my out-of-pocket expenses on the helicopter ride when they Medevaced me to the hospital," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>"I was not making good consumer decisions. I was a patient and I needed all the resources of doctors and nurses to help me get back on my feet again," recalled Bertolini, who has limited use of his left arm since sustaining that spinal cord injury.</div><br/>

        <div>"The use of those services we've figured out, so when you get really, really sick we want to be able to point you to the right places to get well again," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>He likened the typical healthcare consumer to someone blindly filling a shopping cart with items for which they have no idea of the prices and won't see a bill for 30 days, and argued for the need to use available technology to provide the transparency that allows for more informed decisions.</div><br/>

        <div>"In San Francisco a routine colonoscopy costs anywhere from $1,250 to $7,300 in the same market. I don't know what you get with the $7,300 routine colonoscopy but it's got to be good," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>He talks about using a smart phone to track his mail order toothpaste from the point of origin all the way to the side entrance of his house, where he and the dog could "open it," and seemed incredulous that the medical system is so far behind the shipping industry in using new information technology.</div><br/>

        <div>"About 30 percent of what we spend (on healthcare) today is wasted," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>But even with all of the difficulties of changing a highly complex business, Bertolini appears optimistic and ready.</div><br/>

        <div>"It's a huge opportunity and I'm the right person to give the level of energy and level of personal involvement and the conviction to make it a better business," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>"I can't help but think that this is going to turn out good, and when I hand over the baton some time in the future I hope that I have done a good job in getting the company to a place where it will be a lot easier for the next person."</div><br/>

        On the Call Aetna Chairman, CEO Mark Bertolini
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div> Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini talks about the possibility of employers dropping health coverage</div><br/>
        <div>By The Associated Press</div><br/>
        <div>January 31, 2013 2:14 PM</div><br/>

        <div>The health care overhaul takes a major step toward expanding coverage to millions of people this fall, when insurance shoppers will start using online, state-run exchanges to compare and pick policies.</div><br/>

        <div>Many customers will be able to buy coverage that starts in 2014 with the help of income-based tax credits or subsidies. Also starting next year, health insurers will no longer be able to reject customers because they have a medical condition that existed before they applied for a policy.</div><br/>

        <div>These changes have prompted some to speculate that employers will start dumping the health insurance coverage they provide for workers once the exchanges are available. That coverage has been a growing cost burden for many businesses, but it also can be a key draw in attracting new employees and keeping them.</div><br/>

        <div>Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch asked Aetna officials about this possibility during a Thursday morning conference call to discuss the insurer's fourth-quarter. Aetna's earnings sank 49 percent, as medical costs climbed and it booked several one-time expenses. The insurer earned $190.1 million, or 56 cents per share, on $8.96 billion in revenue, not counting one-time items.</div><br/>

        <div>Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini responded to Borsch.</div><br/>

        <div>QUESTION: Do you think some large and small employers may drop coverage heading into 2014 or will that be limited?</div><br/>

        <div>RESPONSE: On the large group side, we don't see a whole lot of activity about dropping coverage. What we will see are the emergence of private (insurance) exchanges, but that will be a slow start in 2014. In the small group market, we don't see a whole lot of impetus for small groups to drop coverage and push their people into the exchanges unless those employees are getting a lot of subsidy.</div><br/>

        <div>We're also seeing a lot of discussion around reducing hours on employees below 30 hours to avoid having to provide health care coverage at all.</div><br/>

        Rate Shock The Scare that Wouldn't Stick
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>It's been a while since you've seen a lot of stories in the media about Obamacare "rate shock," hasn't it?.</div><br/>

        <div>“"Rate shock" stories were all the rage several months ago, like this one from Forbes last December: "Aetna CEO (Mark) Bertolini: Get ready for 'Rate Shock' as Some Insurance Premiums to Double in 2014."</div><br/>

        <div>Health insurance executives were hoping we'd swallow their scare campaign on rates, and thus get behind efforts by their friends in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act.</div><br/>

        <div>Many of those friends, like Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., are members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which sent out a press release on March 14 with the headline: "Obamacare Oversight: The Looming Premium Rate Shock."</div><br/>

        <div>The next day, that committee held a hearing entitled: "Unaffordable: Impact of Obamacare on America's Health Insurance." During that hearing, at which I testified, Blackburn read a long list of what she claimed were names of businesses in her district that had experienced Obamacare rate shock.</div><br/>

        <div>Skeptical, I sent Rep. Blackburn a letter asking if I could see those letters and help her determine if Obamacare was really the blame or if, possibly, and more likely, those businesses' insurance carriers were just gouging them. Five and a half months later, I'm still waiting on a response. Even though I'm from Tennessee too.</div><br/>

        <div>Since that hearing, the headlines have diminished because there's little evidence that the "rate shock" allegations were based on anything other than assertions made by insurance company CEOs and lobbyists and their buddies on Capitol Hill.</div><br/>

        <div>The number of rate shock stories declined as state after state disclosed over the summer what insurance companies will actually charge for policies next year. Those disclosures have shown that not only will premiums not skyrocket when Obamacare's most important consumer protections kick in on January 1, most Americans who buy coverage on their states' online marketplaces will get better deals than they can today.</div><br/>

        <div>A study published last week by the Rand Corporation, a research group, is also helping to show that the rate shock hype was just that: hype.</div><br/>

        <div>Rand researchers said that although prices will vary from state to state, Obamacare will not increase premiums overall. Yes, some people, smokers in particular and folks enrolled in policies with benefits so meager they will be outlawed next year, will have to pay more. But most Americans who will be buying coverage in the marketplaces (also known as exchanges) will be eligible for tax credits that will make their coverage more affordable and, in many cases, cheaper than what is available today. Don't expect a press release from the House Energy and Commerce Committee about that.</div><br/>

        <div>Another study released earlier this month also indicated that Obamacare has not been the cause of recent rate increases. The Kaiser Family Foundation's annual survey of employer-based insurance showed that over the past year, premiums for family coverage increased just 4 percent. While 4 percent is still a hefty increase for many workers, it's far less than the double-digit increases that were common in previous years.</div><br/>

        <div>So what happened to the rate shock scare?</div><br/>

        <div>Politicians and the media were all too willing to repeat what CEOs of big for-profit insurance corporations were saying without analyzing their motives or taking into account the fact that the marketplaces will force real competition in the health insurance world.</div><br/>

        <div>What the insurance company executives were actually "disclosing" several months back was what they would like to charge for their policies on the marketplaces, not what they actually would be able to charge. Aetna, for example, might have liked to be able to charge $500 a month for a certain policy but it won't because its competitors will charge less than that for the exact same coverage.</div><br/>

        <div>We've already seen in Oregon and other states that insurers have been resubmitting lower prices for policies after seeing what their competitors' price plans are.</div><br/>

        <div>I predict that beginning Oct. 1, when the marketplaces go online, most people will discover that because of the new level of competition and the availability of tax credits, affordable coverage will actually at long last be available. To save face, though, you can also expect those politicians who have been crying "rate shock" to search high and low for constituents who believe their policies have grown more expensive because of Obamacare. And, like Rep. Blackburn did last March, some of those politicians will read the entire list of those constituents in a Congressional hearing.</div><br/>

        The 10 Most 'Likeable' Business Leaders on Twitter
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>The expert on likeability shares his method for measuring social media success.</div><br/>

        <div>I've been a student of "likeability" for six years now, researching, reading about, and writing about what it means to be likeable in business. I've interviewed hundreds of executives and leaders for my book and articles to get a better picture for a new model of leadership.</div><br/>

        <div>Being likeable is not about popularity and it isn't about rainbows and unicorns. Likeability, as I define it, is sentiment, community actions, and brand responsiveness. Marketers, entrepreneurs and business executives are all striving toward the same goal: finding a way to answer the question, "How are my brand and I doing on social media?" with a simple metric.</div><br/>

        <div>I've devoted a lot of time to studying online likeability anecdotally, but up until now, I haven't had a way to precisely measure it. That's why I was thrilled when our firm recently introduced the Likeable Index, a tool to measure and track brands' online likeability. The tool looks at online sentiment, responsiveness and community actions across a wide variety of platforms, and scores companies and people between 1 and 100.</div><br/>

        <div>The algorithm is still in development, but we ran some numbers and determined who the most likeable senior executives are at well-known companies. Here's a sneak peek at the top 10 most likeable C-suite execs according to the Likeable Index, and the content each shares across the social web, with a focus today on Twitter, the most easily-accessible platform to measure:</div><br/>

        <div>1. Jeff Jones, chief marketing officer, Target</div><br/>
